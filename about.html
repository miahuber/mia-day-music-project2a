            <h2>About</h2>
              <h4>Groovy fairy cowgirl witch</h4>
                <p>Mia Day discovered her love for storytelling on a half broken type writer under her parents stairwell, moving to songwriting and making music soon after. Inspired by the vivid imagery crafted by  Benjamin Gibbard and Leonard Cohen, as well as the writers heartbeat of Taylor Swift, Day has claimed a songwriting style that embraces the weight that small moments carry. A record store junkie, over thinker, Seattle native that grew up under the endless grey sky, Mia's music turns inward with the harsh vulnerability that comes with spending a lot of one's teenage years alone. Her voice is a strong spirit that marries unconventionality with beauty, softness with a demand to be listened to. At the age of 20 years old, she has released a full length album, "Gold," as well as two E.P's known as "Years" and "Lone Rider." Her music has been played on 90.3 KEXP radio, Rainy Dawg Radio, Chapman Radio, 107.3 KBFG, and at 18 was named one of Sub Pop Records "Best of the Pacific Northwest" on Spotify.</p>
